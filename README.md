# latexTemplate

The purpose of this template is to allow you to create documents in Latex without the need to worry about anything other than filling in some fields (name of the document, author or authors, etc.) and inserting the sections, subsections, etc. that you want.

## Usage

Simply download the repository and compile the .tex file with your favorite Latex editor, or you can upload it to the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) platform and compile it there.

## Important things

A folder with a logo is included to test the template including a corporate logo. To see the format of the document with a logo, the URL "/images/logoUSC.jpg" must be included in the corresponding section within the document's meta-information form.
